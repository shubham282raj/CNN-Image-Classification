# GNR 638 Mini Project 1

## Fine-grained classification:

1. Train a CNN model with an upper limit of 10M parameters.

1. Please download CUB dataset from here: https://data.caltech.edu/records/65de6-vp158/files/CUB_200_2011.tgz?download=1

1. Use default train-test split for this task.

1. Submissions will be evaluated based on parameter efficiency, training time efficiency (no. of iterations) and accuracy.

1. Submissions should include report, code and final model checkpoint. Drive link is fine for checkpoint.

1. Report must include architecture and traiining details. Training loss and accuracy curves should also be incorporated along with final results.

1. External models: Only ImageNet pretrained models are allowed.

1. Please use moodle forum or mail to gnr638@googlegroups.com to post queries.

1. Deadline: March 5 2024, 11:59 PM
